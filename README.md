# About
[Fenster](https://fensterchess.com) is an open-source web application for chess opening research. It uses opening data pulled directly from the github project <a href="https://github.com/hayatbiralem/eco.json">eco.json</a>.

## Tech Stack
Major techs/dependencies are as follows:
* Vite 
* Netlify (a web hosting service)
* Node
* React
* chess.js and kokopu

## Development Environment
The project expects to be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and there is a [free tier](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) that you can sign up for. After installing the dependencies in package.json, you will need to install the Netlify command line interface ([netlify_cli](https://docs.netlify.com/api-and-cli-guides/cli-guides/get-started-with-cli/)). Once installed, you can launch a local web app (localhost:8888) from the command line: `netlify dev`.
